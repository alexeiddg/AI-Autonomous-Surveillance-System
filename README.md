    -   Click on **Add** and select the specific version required for the project `Unity 2022.3.52f1`
    -   Follow the instructions to complete the installation.

### 2\. Python

1.  **Download Python:**

    -   Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version available for Python.
  
2.  **Install Python:**

    -   Run the downloaded installer.
    -   During installation, ensure that the **"Add Python to PATH"** option is checked.
    -   Follow the instructions to complete the installation.
  
3.  **Verify the Installation:**

### 3\. Installing Libraries from `requirements.txt`

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    -   If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine.
    
2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

    -   Navigate to the project directory.
    -   Run `python -m venv env` to create a virtual environment named `env`.
    -   Activate the virtual environment:
        -   On Windows: `env\Scripts\activate`
        -   On macOS/Linux: `source env/bin/activate`
    
3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    -   Ensure you are in the main directory of the cloned repository, where the `requirements.txt` file is located.
    -   Run the following command to install all necessary libraries:

        `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4.  **Verify the Installation:**

    -   After installation, you can verify that all libraries have been installed correctly by running `pip list`.
